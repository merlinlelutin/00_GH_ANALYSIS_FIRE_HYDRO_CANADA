# 00_GH_ANALYSIS_FIRE_HYDRO_CANADA
Codes and data for wildfire-hydrological data analysis in Canada. 
Project initiated as part of my involvement in Global Water Futures.

# What the project does
This project is meant to offer an exploratory analysis of open wildfire and water/aquatic resources data in Canada. The goals is threefold:
 1- To show that wildfire-water risk analyses are doable with existing open data
 2- To suggest possible and more complex studies based on these data
 3- To identify data gaps and suggest evolutions
 
# Why the project is useful
The project is useful because it demonstrates the usefulness of open data to appraise emerging environmental risks (i.e., wildfire-water risks to water security), despite existing limitations. Results can help in the design of future projects focusing on data collection and leveraging in areas hardly covered so far.  
 
# How users can get started with the project
Although the project is empty at the moment, users are free to reuse the code and the data provided herein. Users will have to be proficient in R as well as in GIS. Basic knowledge of pyrogeography, hydrology, and post-fire effects on water resources is necessary to fully understand what was done.

# Where users can get help with your project
Users can refer to the published paper (when it's done). The documentation provided should be enough as well. Users with a specific need can message me on GitHub.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
Myself!
